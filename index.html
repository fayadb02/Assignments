    <h1>Task 1 </h1>
    <p> Economists classify capitalism into different groups using various criteria. Capitalism, for example, 
        can be simply sliced into two types, based on how production is organized. In liberal market economies,
        the competitive market is prevalent and the bulk of the production process takes place in a decentralized manner 
        akin to the free-market capitalism seen in the United States and the United Kingdom. Coordinated market economies,
        on the other hand, exchange private information through non–market institutions such as unions and business associations—as 
        in Germany and Japan (Hall and Soskice, 2001).</p>

 <p> In state-guided capitalism, the government decides which sectors will grow. Initially motivated by a desire to foster growth,
    this type of capitalism has several pitfalls: excessive investment, picking the wrong winners, susceptibility to corruption, 
    and difficulty withdrawing support when it is no longer appropriate. Oligarchic capitalism is oriented toward protecting \
    and enriching a very narrow fraction of the population. Economic growth is not a central objective, and countries with this 
    variety have a great deal of inequality and corruption.</p>
